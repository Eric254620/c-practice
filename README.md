# C Practice in College

This repository stores my C/C++ programming practice in college.

## Goal
- Record my daily learning progress
- Keep every small assignment and exercise

## Files
- `源.cpp` : my first uploaded practice code

## Next
I will continue to upload more files and organize them by folders later.
